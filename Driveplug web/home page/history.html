            <h2>2024: Electric Vehicles Take Over</h2>
            <h1>Renault Scenic E-Tech</h1>
            <p>A compact crossover SUV that won the European Car of the Year 2024 award. It offers a range of over 385 miles, with
                options for 60 kWh and 87 kWh battery capacities.</p>
            <p>The Renault Scénic Vision concept car, introduced in May 2022, features a unique design with no B-pillar and easy
                access to the passenger compartment. Built on the CMF-EV platform, it incorporates 70% recycled materials, including a
                floor made from recycled milk bottles and pipes, and seats crafted from polyester. Inside, it features adjustable screens
                and camera mirrors. The concept is powered by a 160 kW (210 hp) electric motor and a 40 kWh lithium-ion battery,
                supplemented by a 15 kW hydrogen fuel cell as a range extender, offering an estimated range of 800 km (500 mi).</p>
            <p>The production model, released in September 2023, is available in two versions: the Standard range with a 60 kWh
                battery, 125 kW motor, and 420 km range, and the High range with a 160 kW motor, 87 kWh battery, and a range of over
                620km.</p>

            <p>The 2020s saw a significant shift toward electric vehicles with the rise of major manufacturers like
                Tesla, Nissan, GM, and Volkswagen pushing for an electric future. The demand for EVs skyrocketed,
                with government incentives, expansion of charging infrastructure, and better battery technology
                accelerating the transition.</p>
            <p>Several countries, including the UK, France, and Norway, have announced plans to phase out the sale
                of new gasoline and diesel vehicles by 2030-2040. Companies like <strong>Tesla</strong> continue to lead the
                market with models like <strong>Model 3</strong> and <strong>Model Y</strong>, and the global sales of electric
                vehicles have surged dramatically.</p>

            <p>The 2010s marked the introduction of electric vehicles for the mass market. Tesla’s success with the
                <strong>Model S</strong>, the <strong>Nissan Leaf</strong>, and other electric cars set the stage for an EV
                revolution. Charging infrastructure and battery ranges also improved during this time. Tesla helped to cement
                the viability of EVs for long-distance travel with the introduction of the <strong>Model S</strong>, which
                offered a range of over 300 miles on a single charge.</p>
            <p>Other manufacturers, such as <strong>Chevrolet</strong> and <strong>BMW</strong>, introduced their own electric
                vehicles, and the market grew significantly. By the end of the decade, electric vehicles were no longer niche
                products but were seen as a mainstream alternative to gasoline cars.</p>

            <h2>1990s: The GM EV1 and California Mandates</h2>
            <p>The 1990s saw the first major push for electric vehicles with the introduction of the <strong>GM EV1</strong>.
                Despite its early success, the car was discontinued. However, it paved the way for more electric
                vehicle development as automakers responded to California's <strong>Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV)</strong> mandate.
                The <strong>California Air Resources Board (CARB)</strong> passed regulations requiring automakers to produce
                zero-emission vehicles, which led to the development of cars like the EV1, which had a range of up
                to 80 miles per charge.</p>
            <p>Despite the EV1's popularity among its users, GM eventually discontinued the model due to financial
                reasons, sparking debates over the future of electric cars. However, this era laid the groundwork
                for the resurgence of electric cars in the 21st century.</p>

            <h2>1900s: The Golden Age of Electric Vehicles</h2>
            <p>In the early 1900s, electric cars were quite popular and widely used in cities. They were quieter,
                cleaner, and easier to operate compared to gasoline-powered vehicles. In fact, in 1900, electric
                vehicles made up a significant portion of the automobile market. Companies like <strong>Detroit Electric</strong>
                and <strong>Baker Electric</strong> were major players in the electric vehicle market.</p>
            <p>The rise of gasoline-powered vehicles, such as the <strong>Ford Model T</strong>, which was cheaper and had a
                longer driving range, led to the decline of electric cars by the 1920s. However, during this time,
                electric cars were favored by wealthy individuals and urban areas due to their smooth, silent
                operation.</p>
